# Cloud Environment Configuration (AWS Example)
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize

project_name = "detection-lab"
environment  = "cloud"

# For cloud deployments, you'll need to:
# 1. Update providers.tf to use AWS/Azure providers
# 2. Modify modules to use cloud-native services:
#    - siem/ -> AWS OpenSearch or Elastic Cloud
#    - storage/ -> AWS S3
#    - linux-target/ -> EC2 instances
#    - log-shipping/ -> Vector on EC2 or Lambda

# SIEM (OpenSearch)
elasticsearch_version = "2.11"
elasticsearch_memory  = "8g"

# Storage (S3)
# minio_* variables become s3_* variables

# Compute
linux_target_image = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

# Enable Caldera in cloud for team testing
